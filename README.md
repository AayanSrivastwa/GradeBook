🔹 Aim

To write a Python program that helps a teacher record and analyze student marks by calculating average, median, highest, and lowest marks, assigning grades, and showing pass/fail lists.

🔹 Objectives

Input student names and marks.

Store names and marks in a dictionary.

Use functions to calculate:

Average marks

Median marks

Highest and lowest marks

Assign grades using conditional statements:

A → 90 and above

B → 80–89

C → 70–79

D → 60–69

F → below 60

Count how many students got each grade.

Create two separate lists using list comprehension: one for passed students (≥40) and one for failed students (<40).
